# Real-time-Vernacular-Sign-Language-Recognition-using-MediaPipe-and-Machine-Learning
The deaf-mute community have undeniable communication problems in their daily life. Recent developments in artificial intelligence tear down this communication barrier. The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a methodology that simplified Sign Language Recognition using MediaPipeâ€™s open-source framework and machine learning algorithm. The predictive model is lightweight and adaptable to smart devices. Multiple sign language datasets such as American, Indian, Italian and Turkey are used for training purpose to analyze the capability of the framework. With an average accuracy of 99%, the proposed model is efficient, precise and robust. Real-time accurate detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm without any wearable sensors makes use of this technology more comfortable and easy.
